### Dataset

This project explores the US Census Data from Kaggle. It includes the census data for all counties in 2015.

### Objective
The goal of this project is to answer this main question:  How does income and poverty look across America? In order to answer the main question,
I came up with two research questions 

### Research Questions
- On average, what does the rate of poverty looks like in the United States?
- What is the relationship between Poverty and Unemployment rates?

An interactive version of the plot can be accessed on my Tableau Public Link: 
[Income Disparity](https://public.tableau.com/profile/funlola.adeeko#!/vizhome/Income_PovertyDisparity/IncomeDisparity?publish=yes)

#### Insights:
- The bar chart simply highlights the average rate of poverty in the States. The chart shows Puerto Rico to have the highest rate of poverty at 49% and Connecticut with the least rate at 9.4%

#### Insights:

The Scatter plot shows the relationship between the average Poverty and Unemployment rates. The correlation coefficient of 0.64 indicate a positive and moderate relationship between the two variables. This suggests that as Unemployment rate increases, poverty rates increase and vice-versa.
